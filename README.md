# Handwritten-Greek-Character-Recognition
This project focuses on the recognition of handwritten Greek and English characters using machine learning models. Implemented models include KNN, Random Forest, and CNN.

Overview
With the influx of digitized data, recognizing handwritten text is a critical area of research. This project attempts to classify handwritten Greek and English characters using various machine learning techniques, allowing for a comparative analysis of their performance on different scripts.

Datasets
Greek Dataset: Contains handwritten Greek characters.
English Dataset: Contains handwritten English letters from A-Z.
Models
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): A non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): A deep learning model primarily used for image processing.
